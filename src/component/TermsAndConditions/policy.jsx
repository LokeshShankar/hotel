        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p>BookRightAway is a hotel search and offers users information about different types of accommodation (such as hotels, holiday homes, etc.).</p>
        <h2>1.  Scope of Service</h2>
        <p>1.1. These terms and conditions are subject to occasional changes and apply to all our services that are directly or indirectly provided (i.e. via third parties) via the internet, on mobile devices, by email, or by telephone.</p>

           <p> 1.2. By using our website, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to these terms and conditions.
            </p>
            <h2>2. Services and Contract</h2>
            <p>2.1. On the BookRightAway website, you have the ability to compare third-party services via the BookRightAway system.
            </p>
               <p> 2.2. In addition, for some hotels, users have the possibility of booking the selected hotel through a direct connection to the hotel booking sites (third parties) (‘BookRightAway Express Booking’). As a result, the booking will be made directly on the hotel booking site and not on the BookRightAway sites. In such cases, BookRightAway is not the travel operator or the contractual party for the user, but only an agent providing the technical connection to the hotel booking site of a third party. By making a booking on the website of the third party, users agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of that booking site. These terms and conditions can be viewed on the website of the third party. Once a booking is made on the website of a third party, a contract is concluded between the booking site and the user, and therefore no contract is concluded between the user and BookRightAway. BookRightAway is no contractual party to the hotel booking and all and any claims of the user under the hotel reservation are to be asserted against the third party (the booking site) and not against BookRightAway.
            </p> 
            <p> 2.3. This agreement is not affected by any other agreements between the hotel and users.
                </p>
                <h2>3. BookRightAway Community and Member Area</h2>
                <p>3.1. Users have the option of joining the BookRightAway Community (hereafter “Community”) and/ or creating a member account within the BookRightAway Member Area. Users who register for the Community can publish self-generated content, as well as actively participate in the platform’s development via administrative functions. Unregistered users may read the content on BookRightAway for free.
                 </p>
                 <p> 3.2. Using the BookRightAway Member Area users have the option to administer and store their searches. To create the account users are being asked to provide personal information. Despite the Users name, no personal information is made visible. For further information please check our privacy policy. By deleting the account any and all of the User’s data will be permanently removed.
                </p> 
                    <p>  3.3. A user cannot register multiple times. The user is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of their personal information.
                    </p>
                        <p>  3.4. The user is responsible for the confidentiality of their user account information, in particular their password. They are also responsible for the use of their account with regard to BookRightAway and third parties. The user should not divulge this data to use by third parties.
                        </p>
                            <p> 3.5. In the event of unauthorized use of the BookRightAway services using the wrong username and password, the registered user must notify BookRightAway immediately.
                    </p>
                    <h2>4. Privacy, Email Advertisements</h2>
                    <p>4.1. The protection of personal data provided by the user is of the highest priority for BookRightAway. As such, BookRightAway makes every effort to ensure compliance with data protection.
                    </p>
                        <p> 4.2. BookRightAway collects, processes and uses your personal data (hereafter “data”) only if we have obtained your consent or a statutory provision allows for the collection, processing, or use of your data.
                        </p>
                            <p> 4.3. BookRightAway will only raise, process, and use data necessary for the provision of the services rendered by BookRightAway, for the use and operation of the websites/apps, and the services offered. For the use of the ‘BookRightAway Express Booking’ facility, the User expressly agrees to the processing of his/her credit card data by BookRightAway N.V., which may relay these to the hotel booking sites for completing the hotel reservation.
                            </p>
                                <p> 4.4. If the user has agreed to receive information about BookRightAway during registration for the Community or at another time using BookRightAway’s services, the user will receive periodic product information. The consent may be revoked at any time by written communication or by email. The consent to receive emails follows after the confirmation email from BookRightAway is sent. By clicking on the link in the email, you will be registered to receive newsletters.
                        </p>
                        <h2>5. User Obligations</h2>
                        <p>5.1. The user is responsible for the acquisition of rights to the content (text, photos, reviews, links, etc.) they upload to BookRightAway. They ensure that they have all the rights in respect to the content they publish on the BookRightAway platform and thereby do not violate the rights of any third parties.
                        </p>
                        <p> 5.2. The user guarantees not to use the BookRightAway services to create content that:

                              </ul>
                              </p>
                              <p>5.3. The user guarantees not to use programs or functions to generate automated page impressions or content on BookRightAway.

                            <h2>7. Liability</h2>
                            <p>7.1. BookRightAway is not liable for the accuracy, quality, completeness, reliability, or credibility of content provided by users and/or booking sites. In particular, there is no advice or information from BookRightAway regarding the selection of accommodations.
                            </p>
                            <p>7.2. All agreements that arise through this service are between the BookRightAway user and the respective external contracting booking site. In particular, BookRightAway does not act as an organizer or travel agency at any time. The terms and conditions of the respective organizer or travel agency apply exclusively, especially regarding the right to cancel and to withdraw. The contact for the processing of bookings and payments, as well as questions about the contract, is the respective contracting booking site. BookRightAway remains uninvolved in such contractual arrangements, agreements, and claims between the BookRightAway user and the respective external contracting booking site.
                            </p>  
                            <p> 7.3. BookRightAway does not verify the accuracy of content uploaded by booking sites or the members of the Community. This content is provided by booking sites/Communities for publication on our website with reference to the respective hotel. BookRightAway has no influence on this information (in particular images, comments, reviews, etc.). The publication of user-generated content and reports on BookRightAway does not reflect the opinion of BookRightAway, in particular, BookRightAway does not claim this content as its own.
                            </p>  
                                <p> 7.4. In particular, hyperlinks, advertising banners, information about accommodations, travel destinations or providers, and the like are provided by booking sites and Community members and do not represent recommendations or information from BookRightAway. For technical reasons, no updating of the prices we receive from booking sites is done in real-time. Therefore it is possible that the price that appears on the booking site does not correspond to the price specified on the BookRightAway sites. BookRightAway does not guarantee the accuracy of the information, in particular prices and availability.
                                </p>
                                    <p> 7.5. BookRightAway is not liable for technical malfunctions for which the cause is not within BookRightAway’s sphere of responsibility or for damages caused by force majeure. BookRightAway does not guarantee uninterrupted availability of data and may perform technical maintenance during a freely chosen time period.
